  <h1> Montreal Guide Condo </h1>
  <p> During my time with Montreal Guide Condo, I rebuilt their web platform as their old installation did not meet their needs. This includes; </p>
  <ul>
    <li> Modeling a relational MySQL Database to hold data about the listings, advertisements, areas etc... </li>
    <li> Built a MVC backend in PHP for both the Montreal Guide Condo website and their content management system. </li>
    <li> Built the frontend using HTML5/CSS3/Javascript/JQuery for the Montreal Guide Condo website and the content management system. </li>
    <li> Analyzing user behavior on the website. </li>
    <li> Handling SEO in the frontend and backend. </li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2> Accomplishments </h2>
  <ul>
    <li> Rebuilt an obsolete platform, leading to better usability for both visitors and employees. </li>
    <li> Drastically decreasing the load time of pages, leading to user satisfaction, especially on mobile devices. </li>
    <li> Improving the SEO of the website, making it triple its organic visitors per month over a year. </li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2> Features of Interest </h2>

  <p> MtlGC has a fully responsive interface built in CSS, allowing visitors to browse the website at their leisure on any device. </p>
  
  <h3> Improved Search Features </h3>
  
  <img src="/images/mtlgc-search.jpg"/> 
  
  <p> The old platform had a fairly rudimentary search feature. The new one bolsters multiple options to select from, as well as an autocomplete feature that uses AJAX to list regions and cities depending on their popularity. </p>
  
  <h3> Proximity Features </h3>

  <p> An algorithm allows the platform to showcase homes close to the one in the listing viewed.
