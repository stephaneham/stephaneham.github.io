  <h1> Montreal Guide Condo </h1>
  <p> During my time with Montreal Guide Condo, I rebuilt their web platform as their old installation did not meet their needs. This includes; </p>
  <ul>
    <li> Modeling a relational MySQL Database to hold data about the listings, advertisements, areas etc... </li>
    <li> Built a MVC backend for both the Montreal Guide Condo website and their content management system. </li>
    <li> Built the frontend using HTML5/CSS3/Javascript/JQuery for the Montreal Guide Condo website and the content management system. </li>
    <li> Analyzing user behavior on the website. </li>
    <li> Handling SEO in the frontend and backend. </li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2> Accomplishments </h2>
  <ul>
    <li> Rebuilt an obsolete platform, leading to better usability for both visitors and employees. </li>
    <li> Drastically decreased the load time of pages, which caused frustration with visitors, especially on mobile devices. </li>
    <li> Improving the SEO of the website, making it triple its organic visitors per month over a year. </li>
  </ul>
