			<h1> About Montreal Guide Condo / Ma Residence Retraite </h1>
			<p> Montreal Guide Condo is an online directory primarly for condos in the city of Montreal and the surrounding areas. It aims to help users in their search for a condo by providing them with many tools, including a search engine, map features, and an extensive page for each real estate project. </p>
			
			<p> Ma Residence Retraite is very similar in that regard, except it specializes in retirement homes for the elderly. It functions off the same system at Montreal Guide Condo </p>
